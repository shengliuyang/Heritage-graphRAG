## Features

- Multi-turn dialogue support
- Hybrid retrieval combining knowledge graphs and vector databases
- Reference source tracing
- User-friendly interface
- Two deployment versions available

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Neo4j Database
- Ollama (for local model deployment)
- FFmpeg (for audio processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd Heritage-graphRAG
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install and start Ollama:
   - Visit [Ollama website](https://ollama.ai/) to download and install
   - Pull required models:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

5. Install and configure Neo4j:
   - Download and install from [Neo4j website](https://neo4j.com/download/)
   - Create a new database and set password
   - Import world heritage knowledge graph data

![Flask Interface 2](photos/version2_2.png)

This is an improved version developed using the Flask framework, featuring a more aesthetic interface and additional functionality.

To run:
```bash
python web.py
```

## Configuration

1. Neo4j Configuration:
   - Default connection settings in `neo4j_query.py`
   - Default address: `bolt://localhost:7687`
   - Default username: `neo4j`
   - Please modify the password configuration

2. Vector Database Configuration:
   - Data storage path configured in `web.py` and `iu_chat_2.py`
   - Default path: `chroma_data`

## Data Processing Tools

The project provides two data processing tools:

1. Knowledge Graph Data Processing:
```bash
python graph_to_vector/graph_refined.py --persist_directory [your_directory]
```

2. Reference Material Vectorization:
```bash
python references_to_vector/vector_refined.py --persist_directory [your_directory]
```

## Important Notes

1. Before first run, ensure:
   - Neo4j database is running and data is imported
   - Ollama service is running and required models are downloaded
   - Vector database directory is properly configured

2. Troubleshooting:
   - Check Neo4j connection configuration
   - Verify Ollama service status
   - Validate vector database path
